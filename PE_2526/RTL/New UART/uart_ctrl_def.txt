Make a control Verilog block inside UART top that will do the following:
1- Have state machines of 16 states
2- STATE0: wait for a rcieved byte on RX, If recieved: move to STATE1
3- STATE1: look at the value of that BYTE:
- if 0, send this byte back to TX and go back to STATE 0 (communication test)
- if 1 - move to STATE 2 (fill RAM1)
- if 2 - move to STATE 3 (fill RAM2)
- if 3 - move to STATE 4 (fill RAM3)
- if 4 - move to STATE 5 (read RAM1)
- if 5 - move to STATE 6 (read RAM1)
- if 6 - move to STATE 7 (read RAM1)
- all other values: igonore and go back to STATE0
4- STATE 2: get 1024 byets on RX and write to RAM1. Go back to STATE0
5- STATE 3: get 1024 byets on RX and write to RAM2. Go back to STATE0
6- STATE 4: get 1024 byets on RX and write to RAM3. Go back to STATE0
7- STATE 5: read 1024 byets from RAM1 and send on TX. Go back to STATE0
8- STATE 5: read 1024 byets from RAM2 and send on TX. Go back to STATE0
9- STATE 5: read 1024 byets from RAM3 and send on TX. Go back to STATE0
10- STATE 6-14: Do nothing, go to STATE0
11 STATE 15: turn on LED7 for 1 second, turn it off. Go back to STATE0
